## 🚀 About Me

I'm a backend developer passionate about systems, networks, and cloud infrastructure.  
I build APIs with care, design systems that scale, and love digging into logs like a true sysadmin.  

I believe in clean code, secure practices, and that `htop` is a window into the soul of a server.
